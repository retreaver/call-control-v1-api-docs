<p><strong>Where do I get my API Key?</strong></p>

<p>Your API Key is available at the bottom of the &quot;My Account&quot; page. Simply login to CallPixels.com, click your name in the upper right hand corner, and click My Account.</p>

<p>The API Key is not shown by default, click Show to reveal your Key.</p>

<p><strong>Someone hacked my site, how do I reset my key?</strong></p>

<p>Just click Reset Key on the bottom of the &quot;My Account&quot; page in the lower right. The old key will be disabled immediately and you will have to update your clients with the new key.</p>

<p><strong>How can I test this without making a big program first?</strong></p>

<p>We recommend you download the RESTClient plugin for Firefox. It makes it very easy to test RESTful interfaces like ours.</p>
